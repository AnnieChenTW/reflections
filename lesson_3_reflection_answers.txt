When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

   When I want to work with others or when I want to edit my repository from different devices.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Pulling changes manually can let me decide when to synchronize with remote repository and what branch to synchronize. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Cloning involves taking an existing repository and making one just like it. The original repository can be remote or you could clone a local repository 
	into another spot in your computer. That means clone works on any two repositories. Where as forking is only used withing the context of GitHub, it takes 
	an existing GitHub repositories and making a copy of it. Branches only happen in a single repository.
	When you want to develop you code based on somebody's work and work with other people or share with others, you can fork somebody's work without
	having to clone it to your computer, create a repository on the GitHub and set it as remote of your local repository.
	If you are working with others and have the authority to push your changes to some repository, then you can directly clone it.
	When you want to try some experimental work or fix some bug or just divide your work into different parts so you can switch the context, then use branches.	

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    If you know the state of the remote when you pull from it, you get better understanding of what has been changed since then both in locate and remote repositories. 
	You can push all the changes back after effciently handle the merge conflict.
